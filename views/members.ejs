        </div>
        <div class="gardens__body">
            <p>The Gardens on Anderton has over 30 allotments available for rent by members of ATGS. 
                Our allotments vary in sizes and some are raised in order 
                to make access easier for people with mobility concerns. Please note, 
                as we are a seasonal operation, allotments can be accessed from March through October only.
            </p>
  
                <p>The cost of renting an allotment is based on its size. It ranges between $15 and 
                    $30 in addition to the annual membership fee (you must be a member to rent an allotment) 
                    Rental is for one calendar year and priority is given to previous renters.  Our allotments 
                    are very popular and tend to get rented out by February every year so the best time to 
                    check on availability is January.</p>
